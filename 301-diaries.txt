welcome to 301 course:
here i am gonna learn typescript and react  -->frontend developemnt

for installing node on our computer we use nvm(node version manager)
nvm install 18  --> installs node version 18.0

here in react we use npm npx
npx is a CLI tool   which makes easy to run any sort of Node.js based executable that you would normally install via npm

and we have commands like create-react-app for creating a new react project

and we use jsx in this  jsx is javascript xml

variables are mentioned in html  in {}

we have components here 
Always start component names with a capital letter because react treats components starting with lower case as HTML tag.

technically react component is a js function  that we can sprikle up with markup    
jsx syntax   for embedding markup inside it

eg :
const TaskList = () => {
	return <h1>hello world </h1>
}
we can declare above function in the same file and can use this component as <TaskList/> 

CRA:  create react app 
cerate react app
